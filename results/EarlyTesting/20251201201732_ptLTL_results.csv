1/1,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 throughout the entire preceding operation period. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is entering landing mode; then variable_2 (such as descent rate) must have consistently stayed within the safe threshold defined by variable_5 during all prior flight moments.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
2/2,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 throughout the entire preceding operation period. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is entering landing mode; then variable_2 (such as descent rate) must have consistently stayed within the safe limit defined by variable_5 during the entire flight up to that point.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
