1/1,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system shall ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 at all previous moments in time. For instance in an autonomous drone this means that if variable_3 signals an altitude lock activation then the drone must have maintained its current altitude variable_2 at or below the safety threshold variable_5 for the entire flight history prior to that activation.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
2/2,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system shall ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 at all earlier times in operation ensuring continuous compliance with this safety condition in the robot control loop.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
2/3,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system must ensure that at all earlier times either variable_4 was active or variable_2 was less than or equal to variable_5. In a drone control scenario this means that if variable_3 signals that altitude correction is required the controller must verify that at every previous check either variable_4 indicated a stable flight mode or the measured altitude variable_2 did not exceed the allowed limit variable_5.,(variable_3 → H(variable_4 ∨ (variable_2 ≤ variable_5))),H( variable_3 -> H( variable_4 || (variable_2 <= variable_5) ) ),False
3/4,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system must ensure that variable_2 has always been less than or equal to variable_5 throughout the entire previous operation period. For example in the flight control system if variable_3 indicates that automatic landing is enabled then the recorded altitude variable_2 must have consistently remained below the safety threshold variable_5 during the flight.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H((variable_3) → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
4/6,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system must ensure that throughout all previous operation periods the recorded value of variable_2 has never exceeded variable_5. This guarantees that before variable_3 is triggered the vehicle or robot has always maintained variable_2 within the acceptable limit defined by variable_5.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
5/7,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system shall ensure that variable_2 has always been less than or equal to variable_5 at every prior moment. For example in an autonomous aircraft this means that whenever variable_3 indicates that altitude stabilization is active the recorded variable_2 value must never have exceeded the corresponding variable_5 safety limit throughout the flight up to that point.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
6/9,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system shall ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 in all previous operation steps of the robot control sequence.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
7/10,The system shall ensure that at all times if variable_3 is active then variable_2 shall not exceed variable_5 and if variable_4 is active then variable_6 shall always match variable_1. This requirement applies continuously during the aircraft flight control operation to guarantee consistent sensor and actuator coordination.,H((variable_3 → (variable_2 ≤ variable_5)) ∧ (variable_4 → (variable_6 = variable_1))),H(((variable_3) → (variable_2 ≤ variable_5)) ∧ ((variable_4) → (variable_6 = variable_1))),True
