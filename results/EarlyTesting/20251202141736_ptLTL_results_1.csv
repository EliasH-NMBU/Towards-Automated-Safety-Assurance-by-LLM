1/1,Whenever variable_3 is active the system shall ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 throughout its past operation. For example if this logic runs on an automated drone controller then whenever variable_3 indicates that the drone enters a safety check mode the software must verify that variable_2 which could represent engine temperature has never exceeded variable_5 the allowed temperature limit at any time before that moment.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 -> H(variable_2 <= variable_5)),True
2/2,At all times in system operation whenever variable_3 is active the value of variable_2 must not exceed the value of variable_6. For example in the autonomous flight control unit this ensures that whenever variable_3 indicates the stabilization mode is engaged the measured variable_2 such as control surface angle remains less than or equal to variable_6 which defines the safety tolerance.,H( variable_3 → (variable_2 ≤ variable_6) ),H (variable_3 → (variable_2 ≤ variable_6)),True
3/3,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system shall ensure that variable_2 has always been less than or equal to variable_5 at every point in the past. For example in an automated drone control system if variable_3 indicates a stability alert then the recorded altitude variable_2 must never have exceeded the safety limit variable_5 in any previous moment of operation.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
4/4,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system must ensure that variable_2 has always been greater than or equal to variable_5 at every previous moment. In a robotic assembly line this means that if variable_3 indicates a safety override the record of variable_2 which tracks hydraulic pressure must show it was never below the threshold specified by variable_5 before the override occurred.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≥ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≥ variable_5)),True
5/5,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system shall ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 throughout the previous operation period of the autonomous robot. This condition guarantees that the control limits of variable_2 were consistently within the safe range defined by variable_5 before variable_3 occurred.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
6/6,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system shall ensure that variable_1 has always been less than or equal to variable_5 and that variable_6 has always matched variable_2 throughout the previous operation history of the autonomous control unit.,(variable_3) → H((variable_1 ≤ variable_5) ∧ (variable_6 = variable_2)),(variable_3 → (H(variable_1 ≤ variable_5 ∧ variable_6 = variable_2))),True
6/7,The system shall ensure that at all times if variable_3 is active then variable_2 shall not exceed variable_5. If variable_3 is not active then variable_6 shall always match the value of variable_2. This requirement ensures consistent control behavior for the automated vehicle under all operating conditions.,H((variable_3 → (variable_2 ≤ variable_5)) ∧ (¬variable_3 → (variable_6 = variable_2))),H((variable_3 -> (variable_2 <= variable_5)) && (!variable_3 -> (variable_6 = variable_2))),False
7/8,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system must ensure that up to that point variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5. This rule can be applied for example in an autonomous drone flight controller where variable_3 indicates an emergency stabilization mode. In that case whenever the emergency mode activates the controller must verify that the sensor value represented by variable_2 has not exceeded the threshold represented by variable_5 at any earlier time.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
8/9,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system shall ensure that variable_2 has always been less than or equal to variable_5 in all previous moments of operation. For example in an automated aircraft control system this means that if variable_3 indicates an emergency condition then it must be guaranteed that variable_2 the engine thrust level has never exceeded variable_5 the safety threshold before that condition occurred.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
9/10,Whenever variable_3 becomes true the system must guarantee that variable_2 has always been less than or equal to variable_5 throughout the entire previous operation period of the robot.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
