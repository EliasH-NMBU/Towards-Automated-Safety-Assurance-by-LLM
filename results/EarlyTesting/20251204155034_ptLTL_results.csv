0/1,Whenever the aircraft control system transitions into StartUpMode the system shall ensure that checkCommsSensors and checkCommsValves remain continuously verified and show no communication faults for the entire duration of StartUpMode until the system exits that mode. If the system is not in StartUpMode this requirement does not apply.,((H (((! StartUpMode) & (Y StartUpMode)) -> (Y (! ((! (checkCommsSensors & checkCommsValves)) S ((! (checkCommsSensors & checkCommsValves)) & (StartUpMode & (Z (! StartUpMode))))))))) & (((! ((! StartUpMode) & (Y StartUpMode))) S ((! ((! StartUpMode) & (Y StartUpMode))) & (StartUpMode & (Z (! StartUpMode))))) -> (! ((! (checkCommsSensors & checkCommsValves)) S ((! (checkCommsSensors & checkCommsValves)) & (StartUpMode & (Z (! StartUpMode)))))))),H ( StartUpMode → (checkCommsSensors ∧ checkCommsValves) ),False
1/2,The system shall ensure that whenever PCVMode is active; each time a breathingCycleDone event or a patientBreathingRequest occurs; the device shall immediately initiate both breathingCycleStart and inspiratoryPhaseStart. This requirement shall hold continuously throughout operation.,(H (PCVMode -> ((breathingCycleDone | patientBreathingRequest) -> (breathingCycleStart & inspiratoryPhaseStart)))),H((PCVMode) → ((breathingCycleDone ∨ patientBreathingRequest) → (breathingCycleStart ∧ inspiratoryPhaseStart))),True
2/3,At all times in the past; the value of GBPS must have remained less than or equal to 5.2. For example; in the operation of the autonomous drone system; GBPS shall never have exceeded 5.2 at any previous moment during its flight history.,(H (GBPS <= 5.2)),H(GBPS <= 5.2),True
3/4,Whenever PCVMode is active the system shall ensure that inspiratoryTime equals 60 multiplied by the ratio of ItoE_PCV to the product of RR_PCV and one plus ItoE_PCV. This relationship shall always hold for the ventilator control software to maintain correct timing of the pressure control ventilation cycle.,(H (PCVMode -> (inspiratoryTime = (60 * (ItoE_PCV / (RR_PCV * (1 + ItoE_PCV))))))),H( PCVMode → (inspiratoryTime = 60 * (ItoE_PCV / (RR_PCV * (1 + ItoE_PCV)))) ),True
3/5,When the medical ventilator transitions from PSVMode to a different operating mode the system shall ensure that any previous stopVentilation event is followed by either activation of StandbyMode or a return to PSVMode after having been inactive. This behavior shall be maintained consistently throughout operation so that whenever PSVMode was active in the previous cycle and is now inactive the ventilator either enters StandbyMode or reactivates PSVMode only after confirming that stopVentilation was properly completed.,((H (((! PSVMode) & (Y PSVMode)) -> (Y (((Y (stopVentilation & ((Y (! stopVentilation)) | (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode)))))) -> (StandbyMode | (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode))))) S (((Y (stopVentilation & ((Y (! stopVentilation)) | (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode)))))) -> (StandbyMode | (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode))))) & (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode)))))))) & (((! ((! PSVMode) & (Y PSVMode))) S ((! ((! PSVMode) & (Y PSVMode))) & (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode))))) -> (((Y (stopVentilation & ((Y (! stopVentilation)) | (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode)))))) -> (StandbyMode | (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode))))) S (((Y (stopVentilation & ((Y (! stopVentilation)) | (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode)))))) -> (StandbyMode | (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode))))) & (PSVMode & (Z (! PSVMode))))))),H(((Y(PSVMode) ∧ ¬PSVMode) → ((StandbyMode ∨ (¬PSVMode S (stopVentilation ∧ PSVMode)))))),False
4/6,The system shall ensure that whenever RM is active; the outValveClose signal remains true and the inValveOpen signal remains true at all times during operation.,(H (RM -> (outValveClose & inValveOpen))),H (RM → (outValveClose ∧ inValveOpen)),True
5/7,If at any time the powerButton is turned on while the breathingCircuitConnected signal is active; the patientConnected signal is inactive; the airSupplyConnected signal is active; and the powerConnected signal is active; and this is the first time that such a condition has occurred since system start; then the medical ventilator shall enter StartUpMode.,(H ((Y ((powerButton & (((breathingCircuitConnected & (! patientConnected)) & airSupplyConnected) & powerConnected)) & (Z (! (powerButton & (((breathingCircuitConnected & (! patientConnected)) & airSupplyConnected) & powerConnected)))))) -> (StartUpMode | (! (Y TRUE))))),((powerButton ∧ breathingCircuitConnected ∧ ¬patientConnected ∧ airSupplyConnected ∧ powerConnected) ∧ ¬O(powerButton ∧ breathingCircuitConnected ∧ ¬patientConnected ∧ airSupplyConnected ∧ powerConnected)) → StartUpMode,True
6/8,At all times; if FailSafeMode is active; then patientSafe must be true to ensure the patient remains protected whenever the system enters fail-safe operation.,(H (FailSafeMode -> patientSafe)),H(FailSafeMode → patientSafe),True
7/9,The system shall ensure that throughout its entire operation; logParams and saveLog are always active together and loadLog is also active at the same time. For example; the aircraft data recorder shall continuously maintain parameter logging; saving; and loading functions without interruption during all phases of flight.,(H ((logParams & saveLog) & loadLog)),H((logParams ∧ saveLog ∧ loadLog)),True
7/10,If at any time alarmSettingsChanged becomes true after previously being false then the system shall record this event in logAlarmSettings unless there is no earlier system history available. This requirement ensures that every change in alarm settings on the medical monitoring device is properly logged whenever such a change occurs.,(H ((Y (alarmSettingsChanged & (Z (! alarmSettingsChanged)))) -> (logAlarmSettings | (! (Y TRUE))))),(H(alarmSettingsChanged → (Y(¬alarmSettingsChanged) → logAlarmSettings))),False
