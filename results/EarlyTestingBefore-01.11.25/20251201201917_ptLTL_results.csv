1/1,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 up to that point. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is entering a precision landing mode; then variable_2 (such as descent speed) must have consistently stayed below or equal to variable_5 (the maximum safe descent rate) throughout the entire flight history leading up to that moment.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
2/2,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 throughout the entire operational history up to that point. For example; in an autonomous aircraft control system; if variable_3 indicates that the landing sequence has been initiated; then variable_2 (such as descent rate) must have consistently stayed within the safe threshold defined by variable_5 during all prior flight phases.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H ( variable_3 → H ( variable_2 ≤ variable_5 ) ),True
3/3,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 up to that point. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is entering a precision landing mode; then variable_2 (such as descent speed) must have consistently stayed below or equal to variable_5 (the maximum safe descent rate) throughout the entire flight history leading up to that moment.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H((variable_3) → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
4/4,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 up to that point in time. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is entering a precision landing mode; then variable_2 (such as descent rate) must have consistently stayed within the safe limit defined by variable_5 throughout the entire flight history leading up to the landing phase.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
4/5,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 throughout the entire preceding operation period. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is entering landing mode; then variable_2 (such as descent rate) must have consistently stayed within the safe threshold defined by variable_5 during the entire flight up to that point.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H((variable_3 ∧ ¬Y(variable_3)) → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),False
5/6,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 up to that point. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is entering a restricted airspace; then variable_2 (such as altitude) must have consistently stayed below or equal to variable_5 (the maximum permitted altitude) throughout the entire flight history leading to that moment.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H ( variable_3 → H ( variable_2 ≤ variable_5 ) ),True
6/7,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 up to that point. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is entering a precision landing mode; then variable_2 (such as descent speed) must have consistently stayed below or equal to variable_5 (the maximum safe descent rate) throughout the entire flight history leading up to that moment.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
7/8,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 up to that point.    For example; in an autonomous drone control system; this could mean that whenever variable_3 indicates a landing sequence is initiated; the recorded altitude variable_2 must have consistently stayed below or equal to the safety threshold variable_5 throughout the entire flight history.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H ( variable_3 → H ( variable_2 ≤ variable_5 ) ),True
8/9,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always been less than or equal to variable_5 throughout the entire preceding operation. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is entering landing mode; then variable_2 (such as descent rate) must have consistently remained within the safe threshold defined by variable_5 during the entire flight history.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H((variable_3) → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
9/10,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 up to that point in time. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is entering a precision landing mode; then it must be verified that variable_2; representing descent speed; has never exceeded variable_5; the maximum safe descent rate; during the entire approach.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H ( variable_3 → H ( variable_2 ≤ variable_5 ) ),True
