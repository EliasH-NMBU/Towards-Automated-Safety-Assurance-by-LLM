1/3,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; it must already have been the case that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 in the past. In an automated drone navigation system; for instance; this could mean that if variable_3 indicates a successful altitude correction maneuver; then throughout the time leading up to that moment; variable_2 (the drone’s actual altitude) must never have exceeded variable_5 (the permitted maximum altitude).,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H( variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5) ),True
2/4,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must guarantee that variable_6 has always been greater than or equal to variable_5 in all previous operational moments. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that the altitude control mode is active; then it must be ensured that the measured altitude (variable_6) has never dropped below the minimum required altitude (variable_5) at any time prior to activation.,(variable_3 → H(variable_6 ≥ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_6 ≥ variable_5)),True
3/6,The system shall always operate under the condition that; ever since variable_6 became equal to variable_1; it has continuously ensured that whenever variable_3 is true; the value of variable_2 does not exceed variable_5. For example; in an automated flight control system; once variable_6 matched variable_1 (indicating synchronization between two key sensors); the controller must have consistently maintained that whenever variable_3 indicated an active maneuver; variable_2 remained within the operational limit defined by variable_5.,H((variable_3 → (variable_2 ≤ variable_5)) S (variable_6 = variable_1)),H((variable_3 → (variable_2 ≤ variable_5)) S (variable_6 = variable_1)),True
4/7,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has consistently remained less than or equal to variable_5 at all times in the past. In practical terms; for example in an automated aircraft control system; if variable_3 indicates that the landing gear deployment sequence starts; then it must be guaranteed that variable_2; representing hydraulic pressure; has never exceeded variable_5; the safe pressure threshold; before that moment.,(variable_3 -> H(variable_2 <= variable_5)),H((variable_3) -> H(variable_2 <= variable_5)),True
5/9,Whenever variable_3 is active; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 up to that moment. For example; in an autonomous vehicle; this could mean that whenever variable_3 indicates that the autopilot is engaged; the system must confirm that the vehicle’s lateral deviation (variable_2) has consistently stayed within the acceptable corridor limit (variable_5) for the entire preceding time.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
