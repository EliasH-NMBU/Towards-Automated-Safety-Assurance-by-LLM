0/1,As long as variable_1 has not yet exceeded variable_5; the system must ensure that whenever variable_3 is active; variable_2 stays greater than or equal to variable_5. For example; in an autonomous flight control system; before the altitude reading variable_1 rises above the threshold variable_5; whenever the stability control indicator variable_3 is engaged; the engine output variable_2 must always remain at or above the same reference level variable_5.,(variable_3 → (variable_2 ≥ variable_5)) S (variable_1 > variable_5),H((variable_1 <= variable_5) -> (variable_3 -> (variable_2 >= variable_5))),False
0/2,While Y variable_3 has held true in the past; the system must ensure that up until that point; whenever variable_3 was active; variable_2 must have been greater than or equal to variable_5. In practical terms; for example in an autonomous drone; as long as Y variable_3 had been satisfied before; every time variable_3 was engaged—such as a target-tracking mode being active—the altitude control variable_2 should not drop below variable_5; maintaining safe operating conditions until that previous activation point.,(variable_3 -> (variable_2 >= variable_5)) S (Y variable_3),O(Y variable_3 → H(variable_3 → (variable_2 ≥ variable_5))),False
0/3,The system shall always ensure that whenever variable_3 becomes active; variable_2 does not exceed variable_5; and whenever variable_4 is triggered; variable_1 shall; at some point in the future; stay less than or equal to variable_6. For example; in an autonomous aircraft control system; if variable_3 indicates an altitude hold command; then the altitude adjustment rate (variable_2) must remain within the allowed threshold (variable_5); and if variable_4 signals a descent initiation; the vertical speed (variable_1) must eventually settle within the safe descent limit (variable_6).,H((variable_3 → (variable_2 ≤ variable_5)) ∧ (variable_4 → O(variable_1 ≤ variable_6))),H(((variable_3 ∧ ¬Y(variable_3)) → (variable_2 ≤ variable_5)) ∧ ((variable_4 ∧ ¬Y(variable_4)) → O(variable_1 ≤ variable_6))),False
1/4,"Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must guarantee that variable_1 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 throughout the entire operational history up to that point. For example; in an autonomous aircraft control system; if variable_3 represents ""landing sequence initiated;"" then it shall only be possible if variable_1 (for instance; current descent rate) has consistently been within the safe limit specified by variable_5 during the entire flight until now.",(variable_3 → H(variable_1 ≤ variable_5)),variable_3 → H(variable_1 ≤ variable_5),True
2/5,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_1 has always been less than or equal to variable_5 in all previous moments. For example; in an autonomous drone; if variable_3 indicates that a stability control check is triggered; then the recorded altitude rate (variable_1) must have consistently remained below or equal to the permitted limit (variable_5) throughout the drone’s recent operation history.,(variable_3 → H(variable_1 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_1 ≤ variable_5)),True
2/6,As long as variable_1 has been greater than variable_6; the system must ensure that whenever this condition has held; if variable_3 was active; then variable_2 must have been greater than or equal to variable_5.    In a robotic assembly line context; this could mean: for the entire period up to the point where the arm’s load capacity variable_1 finally exceeds its safety threshold variable_6; every time the “height sensor active” flag variable_3 was true; the lift position variable_2 must have been at least as high as the reference height variable_5.,(variable_3 → (variable_2 ≥ variable_5)) S (variable_1 > variable_6),H((variable_1 > variable_6) → ((variable_3) → (variable_2 ≥ variable_5))),False
3/7,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must ensure that variable_2 has always been less than or equal to variable_5 throughout the entire operation history. For example; in an autonomous drone control system; if variable_3 indicates that the drone enters the precision-hover mode; then it must be guaranteed that variable_2; representing the engine temperature; has never exceeded variable_5; the defined safe temperature limit; at any time prior to activating precision-hover mode.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),True
4/8,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system must guarantee that variable_2 has always been less than or equal to variable_5 at every point up to that moment. For example; if a robot’s safety check flag (variable_3) activates; it should only do so if the recorded positioning error (variable_2) has never exceeded the allowed limit (variable_5) throughout its prior operation.,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H( variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5) ),True
5/9,Whenever variable_3 becomes true; the system shall ensure that variable_2 has always remained less than or equal to variable_5 during all past operation time. For example; if this controls the altitude regulation of a drone; then whenever variable_3 indicates flight stability mode is active; the logged values of variable_2 (measured altitude) must show that it has consistently stayed at or below variable_5 (the permitted ceiling limit).,(variable_3 → H(variable_2 ≤ variable_5)),H ( variable_3 -> H (variable_2 <= variable_5) ),True
6/10,Whenever variable_3 is active; the system must ensure that variable_2 has consistently remained less than or equal to variable_5 at all times leading up to that moment. In an automated inspection drone; for example; if variable_3 indicates that the drone is switching to precision-hover mode; then variable_2 (representing current altitude drift) must have always been less than or equal to variable_5 (the acceptable altitude tolerance) before entering that mode.,(variable_3 -> H(variable_2 <= variable_5)),H ( variable_3 → H ( variable_2 ≤ variable_5 ) ),True
