R1;The rover shall not run out of battery;Rover shall always satisfy battery > 0;(H (battery > 0))
R1.1;Charging station location shall be static;Navigation shall always satisfy chargePosition = x;(H (chargePosition = x))
R1.2;Charging station shall be selected as the next destination whenever the recharge flag is set to true;GRA shall always satisfy recharge => (goal=chargePosition);(H (recharge -> (goal = chargePosition)))
R1.3;Battery monitor shall show battery charge 5% lower than currently estimated;Battery_Monitor shall always satisfy battery = pre_battery - 1/n - 0.05;(H (battery = ((pre_battery - (1 / n)) - 0.05)))
R1.4;The interface recharge output shall be set to true when the current battery charge is lower than battery needed to reach the charging station from the current position plus 5% battery charge.;Interface shall always satisfy ((0.95*battery) <= chargeNeeded_var) => recharge;(H (((0.95 * battery) <= chargeNeeded_var) -> recharge))
R1.5;Once at charging station, rover shall remain there until battery reaches full charge.;Interface shall always satisfy (goal = chargePosition & atGoal) => batteryFull;(H (((goal = chargePosition) & atGoal) -> batteryFull))
R1.6;Each step in the plan shall not use more than 1/n amount of battery;Interface shall always satisfy (battery = pre_battery - 1/n * length_plan);(H (battery = (pre_battery - ((1 / n) * length_plan))))
R2;The rover shall not collide with an obstacle;Navigation shall always satisfy ! Obstacle(currentPosition);(H (! Obstacle_currentPosition))
R2.1;Initial rover position shall be static;Navigation shall always satisfy initialPosition = y;(H (initialPosition = y))
R2.2;Current rover position shall be accurate;Navigation shall always satisfy currentPosition = currentPhysicalPosition;(H (currentPosition = currentPhysicalPosition))
R2.2.1;The vision subsystem shall ensure that the initial current rover position as recognised by the Vision is equal to the static initial position;Map_Validator shall immediately satisfy start = s0;(H ((! (Y TRUE)) -> (start = s0)))
R2.2.2;The Vision subsystem shall ensure that the current position is not a position with an obstacle;Vision shall always satisfy ! currentPosition != obstacle;(H (! (currentPosition != obstacle)))
R2.6;Rover shall not go faster than 10kmph;Rover shall always satisfy speed <= 10 km;(H (speed <= 10))
R3.2;Visited heatpoint shall be removed from the list of destinations to visit;If atGoal GRA shall after 1 tick satisfy removeGoalFromSet;((H ((O[0,1] (atGoal & (Z (! atGoal)))) -> ((H (! atGoal)) | (! removeGoalFromSet)))) & (H ((O[2,2] ((atGoal & (Z (! atGoal))) & (! removeGoalFromSet))) -> (O[0,1] ((! (Y TRUE)) | removeGoalFromSet)))))
R3.5;The interface subsystem shall set atGoal flag to true only when the current rover position is equal to the current goal position;Interface shall always satisfy atGoal => currentPosition = goal;(H (atGoal -> (currentPosition = goal)))
